INSTALLATION:

1) Create a fusionticket database, i.e:

mysqladmin -u myuser -p create fusionticket

2) Install/enable the CiviBoxOffice extension in CiviCRM under 
Administer -> System Settings -> Manage Extensions

3) Rebuild civicrm menus if necessary by visiting:
http://www.mysite.org/civicrm/menu/rebuild?reset=1

4) Under the Events menu, access the FusionTicket admin interface by
going to Events -> Manage Seat Maps.

5) Complete the FusionTicket installation process.  You will be asked for
the name/user/password for the database from step 1.  You may wish to 
install the demonstration data which has a few demo seat maps pre-built.
Merchant info and most other settings are not relevant since they will not
be used in this integration.

6) Now when you create an event, you should see a "Seat Map" selector
on the event info & settings page, just under the event start/end time
fields.  If you select and save a seat map setting, the seat map should
appear on the event's registration page.

7) A decent tutorial on creating FusionTicket seat maps is available
on YouTube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb-QPw4dS4E

NOTES:

1) Your Civi events must use a price set where at least one price line 
has a participant count.

2) FusionTicket supports multi-price seat maps, where different sections
have different prices.  FT refers to these price zones as "Categories."  
Currently CiviBoxOffice only supports one FT Category per Civi event. 
Recommend using FT seat maps with only one category for now.

3) The FusionTicket source included in this extension has already 
been patched.  The file ft.patch is included to show diffs from the stock
FT 7.0b distribution.
